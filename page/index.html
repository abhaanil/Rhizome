          <p>Digital technologies and social media platforms are embedded in our everyday lives and have profound
            effects on culture and creative spaces. How are artists responding to tensions of embodiment and virtuality.
            Glitch, motion capture, 3D scanning, algorithms and generative media are introduced, as students consider
            virtual and augmented environments. Themes addressed include game-spaces and diverse online communities,
            avatars, artificial intelligences and other-than-human actors and agents. Supporting interdisciplinary
            studio research, and informed by theories including cyber-feminism, decolonization, the performative and the
            hyper-real, students engage in activities including critiques, studio-based experimentation, concept and
            prototype development, critical readings, discussion and presentations.

            <p>1-2. Principles of connection and heterogeneity:
              Any point of a rhizome can be connected to anything other and must be. <br><br>
              3. Principle of
              multiplicity: it is only when the multiple is effectively treated as a substantive, "multiplicity" that is
              ceases to have any relation to the one as subject or object, natural or spirituality, image and world.
              <br><br>
              4. Principle of Asignifying Rupture: Against the over-signifying breaks separating structure or cutting
              across a single structure. <br><br>
              5-6. Principle of cartography and decalcomania : A rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative
              model. It is stranger to any idea of genetic axis or deep structure.

            The rhizome could also be seen as a potential future tool that could be utilized in mass education. The
            ability to add whatever interests ME into this space seemed like a breath of fresh air throughout my
            personal journey through education. To be able to look through this rhizome, explore it, get inspired,
            research, discover, then finally add to it... I genuinely enjoyed this process. Found myself exploring
            areas/subjects that I wouldn't have thought of before hand. I feel like I can speak for everybody involved
            when I say that I added to my overall knowledge and discovered things that EXCITED me about the future of
            art creation (both my personal art and artists world wide). I'd love to see this get implemented into more
            classes.</p>

            I think that through western
            education we are taught a dichotomizing and catergorzing way of thinking, but as D&G show us, this is so
            oppositional to our nature. The post digital work is human is rhizome.

            <p>Ex-Googler Max Ventilla has a radical idea for how to make it work more like a social network. Ventilla’s

              As time moves forward, the value of doing simple things is decreasing (especially in the work force),
              increasingly, a computer or machine can complete simple tasks. <br>
              As of now, there is not an INDIVIDUALIZED experience in the current education system. PERSONALIZED
              education. You cannot FORCE a kid to learn.</p>

              Rhizomatic engagement with the world is decentralized and non hierarchical. This is in opposition to the
              ideologies that are celebrated under capitalism. Capitalism has pushed for us to strive for
              individuality,  create a brand for ourselves, sell ourselves as unique. That's what gives us value.  Then,
              when we don't feel like an individual (because of the oppositional motive of capitlaism to make us all the
              same -mass production and marketing ) It asks us to spend money and consume to try to oppose that. It's
              a never ending cycle.<span class="highlight"> Although it is virtually impossible to disengage with
                capitalism in the present
                moment, could we use D&G's philospohies to envision a socialist, marxist future?</span>

              Natasha Myer's work , particularly her photo essay "Ungridable Ecologies" seeks to  "break from the very
              forces that science was designed to serve: those capitalist and colonial desires for knowledge forms that
              facilitate the managmnet of lands and bodies"(2). Forming new ways of knowing that oppose capitalistic
              interests, she engages with rhizomatic (one could say) ways of thinking. For me, Myer's work is an
              important link between an rhizomatic engagement as discussed by D&G and marxism. <a

          <p>Ethics is a guiding framework that addresses moral dilemmas and societal values across various domains. In
            the context of modern challenges, it encompasses the impact of technology, such as the immersive virtual
            reality (VR) world, where considerations of consent, representation, and accessibility are paramount. This

            compensation for artists, and the importance of race and diversity, highlighting the necessity of equitable

                virtual reality industry is often seen as an opportunity to develop a more inclusive culture in contrast
                to a heavily male-dominated tech industry. But while men still dominate the virtual reality scene, a
                visibly large presence of women have been at the forefront of shaping the industry as producers,
                start-up entrepreneurs, and pioneers. <a

                been subjugated and discriminated against throughout history going back to the Salem witch trials, where
                any person who was deemed abnormal or slightly alternative was singled out. Those kinds of patterns are

          <p>Capitalist realism, one of the most malign concepts to ever emerge from philosophy and/or critical theory.
            Developed by former CCRU affiliate Mark Fisher in his 2009 book "Capitalist Realism: Is There No
            Alternative?", it is a concept which situates itself after the postmodernism/postmodernity proposed by
            Fredric Jameson. Apart from Jameson, Fisher is inspired by the psychoanalysis of Jacques Lacan
            (schizophrenia, especially) and the schizoanalysis/molecular thinking by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari.
            And of course, who can forget, another source of inspiration was Karl Marx' Marxism. <a

              Viewers were invited to sit in front of Xiao and engage with her by sending a text or Tweet. Xiao
              responded to participants’ messages until they got bored or reached a ‘satisfactory connection’. There was
              a stark and perhaps purposeful contrast between Xiao and Abramovic’s works. While Abramovic wore all white
              and sat in a chair completely visible and exposed to participants, Xiao wore all black, including
              sunglasses, and was almost hidden behind the laptop and phone in front of her. Xiao’s piece speaks volumes
              about the way technology mediates our social connections and relationships, and contrasts between online
              and offline communication.

            <p>What is an algorithm ? It is process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other
              problem-solving operations, especially by a computer. Algorithmic art is aka computer generated art- or
              art created by an automatic system. </p>

              Artificial intelligence likely will accelerate this trend. Much of the most privacy-sensitive data
              analysis today–such as search algorithms, recommendation engines, and adtech networks–are driven by
              machine learning and decisions by algorithms. As artificial intelligence evolves, it magnifies the ability
              to use personal information in ways that can intrude on privacy interests by raising analysis of personal
              information to new levels of power and speed. <a

                Utilizing cameras and code generated artwork simultaneously to create real time artwork thats constantly

              <p>The nature of code-generated art typically results in geometric, abstract shapes, but Norwegian artist
                Espen Kluge manages to render portraits. For his fascinating series, titled Alternatives, the
                tech-driven artist developed his own algorithm that takes in photographs as inputs and then turns them
                into colorful, vector-based portraits. The code loops through the pixels in the raster image and chooses
                some at random. Then, it generates lines in between each pixel to create the strange, three-dimensional
                thread art effect. Kluge never knows how a piece will end up. “It’s impossible for me to have these
                things in my head before I start,” he says. “I would like to think this is true for all generative
                artists. It is a very playful process.” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3bizOzncCV/"

              I didn't think I would be adding a tik tok to the weekly rhizome but a section for it has developed and I
              found this experiment quite interesting. A researcher made an unbiased new account and then only engaged
              with light to moderate content surrounding transphobia, the results are not surprising with what would go
              on to be suggested by the algorithm. This radicalization via for you pages on, most likely, all social
              platforms, (but especially tik tok) is very evident and there should be more people monitoring how the
              system radicalizes the far right, and those who are right leaning but perhaps do not have extreme
              radicalized perspectives from the get-go. Profits over peoples safety is really the clear answer for why
              this is happening. The charts in the video show a great visualization of the issue, I think the research
              for this subject is very needed and a greater experiment needs to be done in order to start thinking of

                artists like Lynn Hershman Leeson. Cyberfeminism came to describe an international, unofficial group of

              <p>Why should our bodies end at the skin, or include at best other beings encapsulated by skin? From the

                move

                unnecessary. For us, in imagination and in other practice, machines can be prosthetic devices, intimate
                components, friendly selves. We don't need organic holism to give impermeable whole-ness, the total

              The impact of plastic surgery:

              If only the defects in appearance are repaired, it cannot be called a negative effect. The frightening
              thing is that under the promotion of the beauty industry, the social plastic surgery trend is the negative
              impact. On the one hand, it is a blow to women’s aesthetics and self-confidence. On the other hand, it is
              the alienated aesthetics fabricated out of thin air, which makes the younger generations at a loss what to
              do. This negative psychological impact is the most deadly, and it will often give birth to plastic surgery
              dependence and develop into new ones. Mental illness.</p>

            Kim De Wolff and Donna Haraway's pieces were two excellent pieces of writing that I found to strongly relate
            to the course material this week. They inspired me to start thinking about ghost nets as a metaphor for the
            human relationship with telematic networks. De Wolff describes these netballs as precarious entrapments,
            neither good or bad but always in flux. There is a malleable relationship between the ghost nets and the
            creatures which inhabit them, synthetic and natural are no longer separate categories. In the same way, our
            bodies are no longer so easily seperated from the networks we engage in, nor the digital landscapes in which
            we inhabit. Our lives are plural and entangled.</p>

              Should there be real life consequences or should it all be online? How many of these repercussions online
              really have any weight when it is so easy to create a new identity for yourself? Should these systems

          <p class="article-title"> NFT</p>
          <p>A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital identifier that is recorded on a blockchain and is used to
            certify ownership and authenticity. It cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided. The ownership of an
            NFT is recorded in the blockchain and can be transferred by the owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded.
            NFTs can be created by anybody and require few or no coding skills to create. NFTs typically contain
            references to digital files such as artworks, photos, videos, and audio. Because NFTs are uniquely
            identifiable, they differ from cryptocurrencies, which are fungible (hence the name non-fungible token).

              The truth is, NFTs are just tokens that represent an asset, completely separate from the assets
              themselves. Because every NFT represents a unique asset, a single NFT can’t be duplicated while
              maintaining the same value as the original. Many equate this exclusive form of ownership with ownership of
              the work itself, but the distinction must be emphasized.

              Pixel art has a rich history dating back to early video games such as Astroids and Space Invaders. Thanks
              to this, the current NFT market has ascribed a nostalgia value for pixel art — however there is something
              fundamentally suited about the artstyle that lends itself to the new profile picture craze among NFT

          <p class="article-title">DIGITAL DIVIDE</p>

          <p>The digital divide highlights the disparities in access to and engagement with digital technology,
            reflecting broader societal inequalities. It extends beyond mere availability of devices and internet
            connectivity to encompass issues like accessibility, digital literacy, and representation. Concepts like
            intersectionality reveal how overlapping factors such as socioeconomic status, disability, or systemic
            bias, compound these challenges for marginalized groups. Practices like shadowbanning and algorithmic
            discrimination further deepen these inequities, limiting diverse participation in online spaces.
            Understanding and addressing the digital divide is essential for creating an inclusive digital landscape
            that empowers all individuals to engage fully and equitably.

              <p>Lesly Oh is a freelance illustrator from Brazil. A lot of her works are fan arts of queer characters
                from various media (TV shows, movies, comics, video games, table-top games...). Some of her works also
                feature characters that were not canonically queer in the media even though they were heavily hinted to
                be, she took those character and shined into them the representations that the queer community longs
                for.
                I think her works are an example of Rhizomorphic Body. Through illustration of these queer characters,

            <p>Micheal Williams prints on canvas and then paints into his images to create art that is situated in
              between both realms. Although one could say his work is physical or tactical, he is able to make his work
              feel very digital through the use of appropriating digital language. His works aim is to "reflect modern
              society's complexity and contradicition"
              <br>
              <span class="highlight">" All objects exist in this dual way today, as both discrete and networked-
                present and dispersed at the
                same time... while any given painting may be specific, the content that it delivers cannot be imagined
                as
                stable and singular, but as reaching any number of eyes and contexts" (Alex Bacon, 17) </span>
              <br>
              On page 19 bacon says " I am somewhat sketiptical about the ability for these kinds of images to hold our
              interst in the long run, and not quickly seem outdated and esoteric." Is William's using sort of "cheap
              tricks" to make art that is very punchy in the moment because of our proximity to it. Does anyone see this
              sort of work as going stale in the future?

              Maija Tammi's work so beautifully deals with the idea of technology and the body, from her "Removals and
              Leftovers" series that explores modern medicine and the aesthetics surrounding it and how it impacts how
              we see our bodies, to her series "One of Them is a Human" where instead of photographing portraits only of
              "real" people she also photographed human-looking robots and it is hard to tell which is which. This
              brings up the uncanny valley. She has many more works that beautifully explore our relationships to our
              mortal natural bodies and our image of them as we navigate these advances in technology. Advances that can
              not only permanently alter our bodies physically, but also change the way we emotionally and
              intellectually navigate the world with them. <a href="https://www.maijatammi.com/artworks/"

              A lot of times a.i beings such as this one make me feel sad. I've been thinking about why exactly they
              stir up a melancholic feeling in myself and I wonder if others feel the same? I question why I feel bad
              for them? Do they want to be human, or do I just project my own human emotions on to them? I don't think
              it's completely fair to see a.i as just a mirror to society, but I can't get past that idea, even though I

            <p>How can this discussion of virtual materiality be re-framed? How are digital technologies and virtual
              spaces not only transmogriphying analog qualities and characteristics/working through material, "real
              world" and virtual entanglements within virtual "dematerialized" domains, but how is the world of
              virtuality implicit in a world of materiality? Or rather, how can digital domains and spaces be
              reconfigured in their relationalities through a material vantage point? How are their physical
              infrastructure existences in the world inseparable from their virtual operations? How do these
              technologies present representations of the world to us? What are the implications of this on a global
              scale and what does this mean in the context of "being human"? How can questions of media theory and
              technology be addressed through a transdisciplinary approach? What insights can New Materialisms paired

              Ken Okiishi’s work reveals a fascination with the translation and migration of meaning and material in a
              world gone digital.
              The resulting series on view in the Biennial, gesture/data, connects the surfaces, screens, and gestures
              that paradoxically link the techniques of gestural painting with the swipes, taps, pinches, and drags that
              characterize the way we interact with contemporary technology. Okiishi has created this series of
              paintings directly on the surfaces of flatscreen televisions playing mash-ups of old analog home VHS
              recordings of TV shows partially recorded over with sequences from new, digitally broadcast television.

                Is it truly possible to create art that is completley decentralised. Or does the artist's intentions
                alone of creating said art work centre them as the creator? I believe digital art has the beginnings of

                The duration of the work will, of course, ultimately, be indeterminate, since this must be a work in
                flux and flow, permitting an infinit y of interactions, inputs and outputs, collaborations and
                conjunctions be- tween its many participants. Since reciprocit y and interaction are of its essence,
                such work cannot diaerentiate between “artist” and “viewer,” producer and con- sumer. To participate in
                such a network is always to be involved in the creation of meaning and experience.</p>

              remixed, as well as copied and pasted into other channels of distribution. <a

              While the territory of poor images allows access to excluded imagery, it is also permeated by the most
              advanced commodification techniques. While it enables the users’ active participation in the creation
              and distribution of content, it also drafts them into production. Users become the editors, critics,
              translators, and (co-)authors of poor images.</p>

            subculture and activism and to me, that's what it is, romanticization. It's nostalgia.

              is the work was already made

              everything we do, no matter how messy and corrupted looking is pre-constructed or the tools were designed
              by a corporation to create the aesthetics to simulate that and having all of those process files be saved
              to the cloud or some other file saving format?

              Isn't the true transgression in the total destruction of the original?

              From Canadian art: "Eliza Chandler, artistic director of Tangled Art and Disability, explains the exciting
              possibilities of framing art practice in relation to disability not through notions of limitations and
              mistakes, but as desirable possibilities.
              <span class="highlight">To crip the arts is to notice, embrace and lead with the difference and disruption
                that disability creates
                within artistic production.</span> Examples of this can be noticed in the work of artists like Carmen
              Papalia,
              Vanessa Dion Fletcher and the late Lisa Bufano. Each of these artists, in their own unique ways, builds
              their art practice around and alongside their experiences of disability and difference.
              This means moving away from requesting inclusion within dominant art practices and institutions, and
              instead thinking about how these aesthetic markers that often signify and highlight disability and
              difference can change and unsettle the larger art world."

                TLDR:
                It can be dangerous to dilute and narow the understandings of the phenomenon (event) by only
                understanding and explaining it through our sensory ground.

                "Seeing the forest for the tree" is the perfect example of "conscious purpose" and poses a threat to
                whole larger systems at play that sustain life, when we make our human perspective the centre of our
                understanding.</p>

              An interesting opinion piece on Facebook's "metaverse" - Horizon. It's not fully fleshed out yet, but the
              idea is that Facebook wants to create an all encompassing work-leisure-entertainment platform with XR
              compatibility so that people can meet in virtual spaces. There are many different opinions on this - some
              people are excited, some people are apprehensive. I think, in its final form, it will be reminiscent of
              Ready Player One's OASIS. Personally I am excited, but I fully understand the negative results that could
              come from complete XR immersion all the time. <a

              depth of knowledge and their human-like feelings. However, their cold logical philosophical conversation
              becomes some-what of a existential crisis for the both of them. Definitely creepy.<a

              <p>Talks about the development of CGI and the 4 CGI territories: <br>
                1. The Uncanny Valley: mids 90s - when
                photorealistic rendering began on a mass industrial scale in cinema - Pixar
                GPU rendering engines= stacking powerful graphics cards to render an image with accuracy speed and
                clarity than ever before. <br><br>
                2. The Frontier: novelty of seeing physical phenomas - where anything can be imitated - big studios want
                to increase: volume, scale, speed, freq, density Ex. Age of Ultron . More bodies , machines,
                optimization
                the goals of this are to:: build upwards, outwards , increase speed , volume and frequency and about
                commerce, constrution and consolidation. <br><br>
                3. Beyond the Frontier: Post truth, post cinema, theoretical photorealism
                post truth; counterfeiting image , as computer graphics get better, we will believe images less
                post cinema: shot are cut together so quickly its hard to understand what is happening .. post cinematic
                effect : continuity and space and time is lost in intense sequences of CGI and FX.
                because 1. virtual cameras are not limited to space 2. cgi can tweak physics ex. creating surreal
                pyrotechnics 3. no such thing as slow CGI
                theoretical photorealism; unobserved but visually accurate , sciences using CGI to demonstrate a site
                beyond sight. <br><br>
                4. Wilderness: Idea of the digital grotesque
                satirize the high and powerful - deep fakes -
                where software excels and where labour must be concentrated.
                where nature flirts with fashion aesthetics
                ex. Eva Papamargarati .

                Valley as these robots are able to replicate movements and mannerisms much like those of a human. as
                their robots have become more advanced, in this video you can see them even performing some basic

                This video is a great breakdown of the Boston Dynamics video and why it "can't be faked" with VFX, since
                a lot of commenters on the original video were claiming that the robots aren't real and are just CGI.
                It's wild that robotics have become so advanced that people's brains just can't process what they're
                seeing and they assume it's fake. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ1WEiMwV7Y"

              common right now. Different people have different feelings. Maybe sometimes they are being tired that
              talking with real humans, but they have a lot of fun talking with artificial intelligence.</p>

              The human relationship with the soul following the lines of technology is very interesting. Throughout
              human history, with the invention of telephones people tried to hear the soul. With the X-Ray people tried

              Jean Baudrillard’s work on the “hyperreal” serves as a useful critical paradigm in thinking about how
              persistently these images bleed into the fabric of Native American lives off the page or screen as the
              Hollywood Indian has come to stand in for self-generated representations of Indigenous people: “Simulation
              . . . is the generation by models of a real without origin in reality: a hyperreal. The territory no
              longer precedes the map, nor survives it.” 68 This simulation is not an “indiscriminate, inchoate
              condition,” as Baudrillard supposes, but an everyday practice that Michel de Certeau would locate as “the
              place from which discourse is produced.”

            <p>A 2019 Chinese science fiction film directed by Frant Gwo, loosely based on the 2000 novella The
              Wandering Earth by Liu Cixin. Set in the far future, it follows a group of astronauts and rescue
              workers
              guiding the Earth away from an expanding Sun, while attempting to prevent a collision with Jupiter.

            <p class="article-subsubtitle">◦ SNOW PIERCER </p>
            <p>Society has fallen, the only people who remain are those stranded on a train. On the back of the
              train
              people live in poverty, barely surviving, whilst the front people live in luxury. One of the people
              from
              the tail end (Curtis) decides to revolt and the movie details his journey through the train.
              Whilst it's sort of obvious that this movie is meant to metaphorically represent modern capitalist
              society, I was also thinking about all the ways that it more specifically reflects hyperreality.
              The "engineer" of the train has modelled it after pre-apocyliptic society so that one could say it
              almost "simulates" it. Arguably, the train authentically produces the symptoms of what society really
              was, so that it can really be felt.Many of the passengers have only experienced life on the train, and
              in this way, the train is very real to them. However, to some who still remember life before it
              doesn't
              even come close (although perhaps with time memory fades, so to them it also becomes more and more
              real). While some of the characters would make arguments one way or the other, no one can firmly
              categorise this train as "real or not real". The movie therefore begs the question, Is this train a
              simulation of society, or has it just become society itself, and is there a difference either way?</p>

            <p class="article-subsubtitle">◦ IN TIME </p>
            <p>Film is based on a social system that uses time as its currency. Wealthy people live longer than 100
              years. Due to strategically imposed increases in living costs,
              others struggle to afford life-sustaining goods (food and shelter).
